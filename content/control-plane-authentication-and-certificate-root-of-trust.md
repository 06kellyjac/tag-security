The orchestrator administrators should configure all orchestrator control plane components to communicate via mutual authentication and certificate validation with a periodically rotated certificate in addition to existing control plane hardening. The issuing Certificate Authority (CA) can be a default orchestrator CA or an external CA. Particular attention should be given by the administrators to protect the CA's private key. For more information on extending or establishing trust, refer to the Identity and Access Management section.
