Designing a system with the appropriate set of security controls that address regulatory and compliance guidance makes cloud native resources more secure. Doing so may also make certification by relevant regulatory bodies and auditors easier, particularly if the system design and planning is done to allow automated compliance to various regulatory bodies through a plugin model. While compliance often requires utilization of security benchmarks for increased security and configuration management enforcement, such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks, it is important to note that utilization of machine readable compliance control frameworks and languages are recommended.
