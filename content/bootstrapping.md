## Examples
- Bootstrapping trust into a platform can be done via attesting a platform, and providing a credential/identity to prove trustworthiness. This can be done via using cloud provider APIs or through the attestation of hardware security roots of trusts
 - Projects such as keylime provide the ability to perform attestations of nodes, including attestation of TPM PCRs
 - SPIFFE/SPIRE allows the provision of identity based on attestations
