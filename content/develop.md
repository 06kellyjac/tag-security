Security for cloud native applications needs to be deployed throughout the entire lifecycle of an application.
The "Develop" phase is the first in this cycle, resulting in the creation of the artifacts, such as Infrastructure as
Code, application and container manifests, etc., that will be used to deploy and configure cloud native applications.
Consequently, these artifacts have proven to be the source for numerous attack vectors that can be exploited in the
runtime. The next few sections elaborate on the various security tools, processes, and checks that need to be
instituted in this phase to dramatically reduce the attack surface of applications deployed in the runtime.
