The Cloud Native Security map builds on top of the Cloud Native Security Whitepaper by TAG-Security, by providing an additional practitioner's perspective as well as an interactive mode of consumption, to facilitate the exploration of Cloud Native Security concepts and how they are used. The Cloud Native Security Map provides mapping of security topics to projects that one can use, as well as provide some examples of using these projects to help illustrate the controls and configuration required.
