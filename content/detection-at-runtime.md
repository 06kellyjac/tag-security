## Examples
- Building automated learning models of the application behavior in the runtime
- Ensuring that only sanctioned processes, system calls are allowed to execute. For example, the execution of known malware should be identified and prevented 
- File Integrity management: critical file systems that contain secrets and other files should not be modified 
Network access: egress traffic from containers to C2C and other malicious domains should be detected and prevented.
