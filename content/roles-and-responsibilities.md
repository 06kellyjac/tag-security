When moving to cloud native architectures and deployments, organizations should expect to see adjustments in legacy security roles and responsibilities and create new security roles specific to the cloud. With the rapid onset of modern development methodologies and better alignment of IT activities with business needs, security must be adaptive, commensurately applied with actual risk, and transparent. It is unreasonable to expect developers and operations to become security experts. Security practitioners need to partner with developers, operations, and other project life elements to make security and compliance enforcement fully integrated with process modernization efforts and development lifecycles. Doing so means findings are reported in real-time through the tools in use by developers for habitual resolution, akin to how build failures are resolved at notice.

The blurred lines that often occur in DevOps environments should not replace clear separation of duties (SoD) when it comes to managing security in cloud native environments. While developers will be a lot more involved in implementing and executing security measures, they do not set policy, need not gain visibility into areas that aren't required for their role, etc. - this separation should be implemented between roles and across product and application teams in accordance with the organization's risk tolerance and business practices. It is understood this becomes difficult with smaller organizations when individuals perform many duties to keep the business thriving. Nevertheless, implementing a distinct role to permission alignment can assist in enforcing SoD as the organization continues to grow and cognitively forces a mental switch in the activities being performed by the individual. Ultimately, allowing for reorganization roles to be reassigned to new individuals without increasing scope of access with the new assignment.

Organizations will need to reevaluate their asset risks as products and services migrate to the cloud. With ownership and management changes of the technology in use and its deployment stack, executives should expect significant risk posture changes. Shared responsibility between providers and teams will require changes to thresholds in risk acceptance, transference, and new mechanisms for mitigation.
