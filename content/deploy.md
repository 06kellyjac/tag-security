Security integrated throughout the development and distribution phases allows for the real-time and continuous validation of candidate workload attributes (e.g. signed artifacts are verified, container image and runtime security policies are ensured, and host suitability can be validated). Secure workload observability capabilities, deployed alongside the workload, allow for logs and available metrics to be monitored with a high level of trust, complementing integrated security.
