The "Compute" layer provides the foundational components that enable DevOps teams to deploy, run and manage cloud native applications. It is important to have an understanding of the various components that constitute this layer and more importantly grasp the various threat vectors associated with this layer. Examples components of this layer include the physical and virtual machines, container orchestrator, running containers, service mesh and others. In the following sections we describe each of these foundational components and list tools that are available to manage, run and secure accordingly.  
Securing the compute layer both from a breadth and depth perspective is critical to ensure mission critical applications are run securely and reliably.
