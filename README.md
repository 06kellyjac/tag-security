# Cloud Native Security Map

This is the repo for the web dev of the Cloud Native Security Map (https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/issues/348).

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Or run `npm start` or run `npm run build` and server statically with something like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
